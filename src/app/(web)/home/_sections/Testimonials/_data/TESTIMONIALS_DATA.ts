            Is there a platform where I can sponsor people to add features to an OSS project?
            <br/><br/>
            For example, let's say I have to implement a feature on @OramaSearch but I have no capacity right now.Is there a place where I can put a kind of "bounty"(I know it's not the right word) on this activity?

            I encountered this issue on November 5, 2022.
            <br/><br/>
            This discussion started on December 22, 2021.
            <br/><br/>
            Now it's August 2024, and still NOTHING has changed - just some workarounds and hacks.
            <br/><br/>

            Is there a way to give bounties for devs that find non-security related bugs, or event issues on your open source project?
