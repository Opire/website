        question: "In which countries can I use Opire?",
        answer: `
            Opire does not explicitly prohibit its use in any country. However, when using a payment provider like Stripe, the user is subject to the conditions imposed by Stripe.
            <br/><br/>
            Before creating a reward, make sure that your country is supported on Stripe.
            <br/><br/>
            You can check the list of supported countries <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7223750176866258944" target="_blank">in our LinkedIn post</a>

        answer: `
            Yes, our commands can be used within private projects, but there is a detail to consider.
            <br/><br/>
            The created rewards will appear on the Opire platform, but developers without access to the project won't be able to try to solve the issues or claim the rewards.
            <br/><br/>
            If external people want to collaborate, they'll need to communicate directly with the project administrator to request access.

        question: "Who is Opire for?",
        answer: `
            Several groups can benefit from Opire:
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Developers</strong>: It is an opportunity to earn extra income without being tied to schedules or cumbersome procedures. Additionally, you'll enhance your skills by solving real problems in different languages.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <strong>Companies</strong>: We facilitate problem resolution in your project dependencies without involving your development team. Therefore, you can optimize your costs by focusing resources on what adds value to the company.

                <li>
                    <strong>Open-Source Enthusiasts</strong>: Unlike donation platforms, bounties on Opire are tied to a real project issue, directly impacting the improvement of code quality. You won't be an anonymous donor, instead you will actively participate in project enhancement and growth.
                </li>

        answer: `
            No.

            You only need to enter a payment method when paying for the bounties you've previously created.

        answer: `
           If someone has tried to pay you but your Stripe account wasn't configured, the payment cannot be processed, and we will notify you to configure your account.
           <br/><br/>

        question: "How are payments made on Opire?",
        answer: `
            Payments are processed through Stripe. Once an issue is solved and bounty creators proceed with payment, developers receive the money directly into their configured Stripe account.

        question: "If I receive income, how do I declare the benefits?",
        answer: `
            Since you can receive income from anywhere in the world, we can't provide a solution that fits the requirements of each country (it's out of our scope).
            <br/><br/>
            The person receiving the income is responsible for complying with their country's legislation, declaring it as required in each case. You can obtain a list of your income directly from your Stripe account.

        question: "What if I don't get paid for the bounty?",
        answer: `
            If you find yourself in that situation, we're sorry for what happened ðŸ’”
            <br/><br/>
            First, try to communicate with the bounty creator. They may not be aware that they can already pay you, they may have forgotten, or they haven't been able to do so yet. We trust the community and its ability to resolve conflicts through dialogue.
            <br/><br/>
            Opire is a tool designed for the community, and we hope it is used in the right way. We understand that it's not always the case, and for situations where a user has created many bounties that they don't intend to pay, Opire has algorithms that detect such behavior and disable the user to prevent further harm to the community. These users won't be able to create more bounties until they process the payment for the pending ones.

        id: "3",
        question: "What happens to my money if Opire disappears?",
        answer: `
            You wouldn't lose a single cent.
            <br/><br/>
            At Opire, we don't retain funds for future use. Your money will always be in your hands until you decide to pay the developer.
            <br/><br/>
            We also won't ask for your credit card or banking information. We don't have access to that data (nor do we want it), so there will never be any unexpected payments.
            <br/><br/>
            When you make a payment on Opire, everything is handled through Stripe, and developers receive their share directly. Opire only keeps the corresponding % for our fee when processing bounties/tips payments.
        `,
    },
    {
        id: "4",
        question: "When do I receive my payment?",
        answer: `
            Once the bounty creator initiates the payment, the funds will be transferred to your Stripe account within 1 to 7 days, depending on the chosen payment method.

            Yes.

            The bounty creator will decide who to pay, typically rewarding the developer whose PR gets merged.

    {
        id: "4",
        question: "How are bounties priced?",
        answer: `
           Bounties are set by the people who want the issue to be solved, based on the complexity and urgency. Bounties can be stacked so different people can put in different amounts.

        question: "What happens if my PR is rejected?",

           If your PR does not meet the required standards, it may be rejected. However, you can work on improving it and resubmit it until it is approved, or another developer's solution may be accepted.
           <br/><br/>
